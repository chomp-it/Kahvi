# Kahvi
CoffeeScript on its own allows you to write apps much faster than with plain JavaScript, however, you still have to jump over verbose hurdles like `x = document.getElementById 'some-id'` or `x.addEventListener ...`. I wrote Kahvi -- nicknamed French Press CoffeeScript -- to solve these problems. And yes, the name is inspired by Ruby on Rails.

French Press CoffeeScript doesn't get in your way for your actual app logic; it only helps you get there faster; there are no magical conventions over things, just faster and cleaner ways. Let's get into the actual syntax of French Press CoffeeScript.

Kahvi currently only has five special expressions/functions.

First:

```coffeescript
when ‘some-button-id’ is clicked ->
  console.log “some button was clicked”
```

This is a shorthand for event listeners, but it also pulls down the element implicitly, cutting down on a lot of boilerplate.

Here is the CoffeeScript version:

```coffeescript
document.getElementById('some-button-id').addEventListener 'clicked', () ->
  console.log “some button was clicked”
```

In place of 'clicked', you can also pass these other options:
- submitted
- highlighted/mousedover
- unhighlighted/mouseoff
- Typed/typing
- changed

Another example:

```coffeescript
when ‘some-button-id’ is mousedover ->
  console.log “some button was moused over”
```

Second:

```
enforce ‘some-id' as a word
```

This is a bit more magical than the first expression, but it's really just verifying input -- an action that is otherwise extremely tedious.

Code speaks louder than words, however, so let me show you the CoffeeScript equivalent:

```coffeescript
unless document.getElementById ‘some-id’.value.match /^[a-zA-Z]+$/
  alert “input rejected: it must be a string.”
  return
```

Long story short, it will alert with a default message saying the input was rejected because it must be <type> unless it matches the requirements.
I haven't added it yet, but in the future it will perform a second check for null values or empty inputs to give a more detailed alert.

As of now, there is only one other alternative type: integer/number.

You can also use string as an alias to word.

Third:

```coffeescript
someButton refers to ‘some-button-id’
```

This is really just assigning someButton to 'some-button-id'. Here's the equivalent CoffeeScript:

```coffeescript
someButton = document.querySelector ‘some-button-id’
```

The fourth and fifth features are just one word functions:

`hide x`

Evaluates to

`x.style.display = ‘none’`

And its opposite:

`display x`

Evaluates to

`x.style.display = ‘block’`

# Generate

This is the other side of French Press CoffeeScript: it is used to scaffold files.

Right now, the only function is to create a "page" -- which consists of a .frenchpress file,  a .styl (Stylus), and an HTML file.

Here's how it looks:

`fp generate blog`

Outputs:
- blog.html
- blog.styl
- blog.frenchpress

And it appends this to your master script:
```
fp full_send blog.frenchpress
stylus blog.styl
```

Allow me to explain what the master script is.

The problem with preprocessors has always been wrangling the compile scripts; for the equivalent page setup you would have to track the Kahvi command as well as the stylus command, and then write them manually each time, as well as repeating that process for each page. If you generate a page using Kahvi, those commands will automatically be added to your masterscript. Once your app starts to get a bit bigger, this masterscript process should save you a good amount of time.


# Conclusion

Hope you enjoyed. This is in active development so bugs are quite common.
I am working to add new features and fix bugs when I can.
